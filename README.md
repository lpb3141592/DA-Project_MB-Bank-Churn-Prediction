# ðŸ“‰ DA-Project_MB-Bank-Churn-Prediction

## ðŸ“Œ Overview  
This project focuses on predicting **customer churn** for a banking service based on customer transaction history and service usage patterns. Using data from late 2020 to mid-2021, the analysis uncovers behavioral patterns tied to customer attrition and builds machine learning models to anticipate potential churners.

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose  
To provide insights into:

- Customer behavior leading to churn  
- Key indicators of disengagement (e.g., service inactivity, low transaction frequency)  
- Demographic vs. behavioral impact on churn probability  
- Effective modeling strategies for predicting future churners
